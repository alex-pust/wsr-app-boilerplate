Box is a wrapper component that provides a way to align, space, resize and style - easily and straightforwardly.

This component behaves exactly like “CSS Flexbox”, therefore any related **valid** CSS property is exposed as `prop` (excepts `flexDirection`, `justifyContent` and `alignItems` which are wrapped specifically with appropriate `props`).
